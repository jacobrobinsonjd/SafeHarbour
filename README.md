# Safe Harbour
Potential Proposed Securities Act (Ontario) Rule 73.8. Exemption for Qualifying Tokens.

# Proposed Safe Harbour – Exemption for Qualifying Distributions of Digital Tokens for Autonomous Networks.

***This draft is not a rule, regulation, or statement from any securities regulatory body in Canada, or anywhere else. It cannot be relied on.  It is a personal fork of the Github proposal submitted by Commissioner Peirce (CommissionerPeirce/SafeHarbor2.0:main). This version is drafted to suit securities laws in Canada, specifically the Securities Act (Ontario). Prior forks (such as https://github.com/LeXpunK-Army/SafeHarbor2.0) were helpful and used in drafting, as was commentary from thought leaders in the digital asset space. MiCA offered a helpful guideline for potential disclosure rules. Particularly grateful for Preston Byrne's critical analysis of Commissioner Peirce's proposed Safe Harbor, from which this proposal was inspired. 

This Safe Harbour differs from other proposals in two primary aspects: 1) there is not time-limitation for the exemption granted and 2) it is only available to projects where tokens are not sold in the first instance, but are earned by participants in the network. 

## Proposed Securities Act (Ontario) Rule 73.8. Exemption for Qualifying Tokens.

***Preliminary Notes:***

1. *Not all Tokens are created equal. Some are sold as part of an investment contract, while others are not. Concluding that a digital asset (Token) is a security is a threshold question for which an affirmative answer imposes barriers to the development of a nascent and novel technology. Many Tokens are considered securities and/or derivatives by securities regulators, while others, such as bitcoin, are not considered a security and/or derivative. While a Token may be offered and sold as a security because it is wrapped in a transaction involving an investment contract, Tokens are also issued solely in exchange for participation in a network (such as to participants in exchange for expending effort or energy). An example of this is a miner on the Bitcoin network who inputs the correct nonce required to find a numeric solution to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide difficulty target, after which, among other things, the miner is rewarded with newly created bitcoin. This bitcoin does not need to "morph" away from classification as a security via the amorphous operation called "decentralization", because the bitcoin was not issued in  an investment contract.*

*[NTD: The issuance of a particular Token in a manner that is solely in exchange for participation in the network, rather than in exchange for an investment of money, should not constitute a "sale" of a security via an investment contract as there are no "sellers" or "purchasers". This distinction and method of issuance is critical to this Proposal]. While an unnecessary distinction, there is also no "common enterprise", only a group of individuals holding a similar asset (analogous to the iron ring give to Canadian-trained engineers as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession). Just as Canadian engineers do not expect the iron ring maker to increase the value of the iron ring, anyone holding the Token could not reasonably expect the publisher of the software or any person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts.]*

*[NTD: needs editing] However, for a network to mature into a functional or decentralized network that is not dependent upon a single person or group to carry out significant managerial or entrepreneurial efforts, the Tokens must be freely tradeable by potential users, programmers, and participants in the network. Moreover, the publishers of the network and those willing to update and build upon the network must be able to do so without fear of falling afoul of Canadian securities laws. The uncertainty of the application of the securities laws throughout Canada to the issuance and any secondary transactions (purchases or sales) of these Tokens frustrates the network’s ability to achieve maturity and functionality, while also preventing potential purchasers of Tokens or creators of networks from benefiting.*

*[NTD: to edit - we want to avoid one organization having sole control over the network, but at the same time encourage the developent of the network] Accordingly, this safe harbour proposal (the Proposal) is intended to provide Initial Development Teams with the comfort to develop and publish a network through a fair launch, which allows for anyone to participate in the network to earn Tokens. To best achieve this goal, the Proposal includes a distinction between any equity raises the Initial Development Team conducts to ensure those are separate from the Token issuance and allows the Initial Development Team to utilize the Token to facilitate participation in, and the continued development of, a blockchain-related network, exempt from certain provisions of the provincial securities laws so long as certain conditions are met. The safe harbour does not provide the Initial Development Team with any right or ability to issue equity in exchange for an investment of money. This Proposal is designed to protect secondary Token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to the needs of the purchasers and preserving the potential application of the anti-fraud provisions of the provincial securities laws to statements and disclosures made regarding the Token by an Initial Development Team.*

*It is unlikely, but unclear, whether any secondary sales implicate provincial securities law. This Proposal allows for exemption from provincial securities laws for developers and users of networks through a framework that aligns with the principals of the securities regulatory laws throughout Canada.*

*[NTD: Unsure if necessary] The definition of Network Maturity is intended to provide clarity as to when the Initial Development Team is no longer required to develop the network, but the analysis with respect to any particular network will require an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances.*

2.  *Rule 73.8 is not an exclusive safe harbour. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 73.8 still may claim any other available exemption under the Securities Act (Ontario) for the offer and sale of Tokens, provided they qualify.*

**(a)  Exemption.**  Except as expressly provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Securities Act (Ontario) does not apply to any initial issuance, or secondary offer, sale, or transaction involving a Token if the following conditions are satisfied [by the Initial Development Team], as defined herein.

&ensp; &ensp; (1)  The Token is only created in the first instance through some manner of participation in the network, except for the transfer of funds from a purchaser. For clarity, the Initial Development Team cannot sell, hold back or allocate Tokens, and all Tokens must be created in the first instance through a fair launch process which enables anyone to participate in the network.

&ensp; &ensp; (2)  Disclosures required under paragraph (b) of this section are continuously made available on a freely accessible public website.

&ensp; &ensp; (3)  The network must be launched in a manner whereby individuals not part of the Initial Development Team are freely able to participate, provided they have the required software and hardware. The Token must be created for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network.

&ensp; &ensp; (4)  Any upgrades to the network by Initial Development Team, its members, and, to the extent known by the Initial Development Team, any related persons (and all rights, benefits and powers with respect thereto) are disclosed on a publicly accessible website.

&ensp; &ensp; (5)  The Initial Development Team files a notice of reliance in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and abides by the requirements in Rule 73.8.

&ensp; &ensp; (6)  No person, including but not limited to members of the Initial Development Team, shall have a right to obtain Tokens in a manner that is distinct from how any third party could obtain Tokens. 

&ensp; &ensp; (7)  An exit report is filed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.  

**(b)  Disclosure.**  The Initial Development Team must provide the information described below on a freely accessible public website. Such information must be updated within five business days of a material change. Any public updates made to a code repository will be announced through similar means, along with a link to the code repository which contains the change.

&ensp; &ensp; (1)  *Initial Disclosures.*  Prior to filing a notice of reliance on the safe harbour, provide the following information.

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (ii)  *Transaction History.*  A narrative description of the steps necessary to independently access, search, and verify the transaction history of the network, such that a non-technical individual could understand the instruction.

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (iii)  *Token Economics.*  A narrative description of the purpose of the network, the Token, the protocol, and its operation.  At a minimum, such disclosures must include the following:

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (A)  Information explaining the launch and supply process, including the total number of Tokens possible to be created by the network through the code, mechanisms for changing the total number of Tokens to be created, the mechanism for issuing Tokens, the release schedule for the Tokens, and the total number of Tokens outstanding;

**(k)  Definitions.**

&ensp; &ensp; (1)  *Initial Development Team.*  Any person, group of persons, or entity that provides the essential managerial efforts for the development of the network prior to reaching Network Maturity and makes the initial filing of a notice of reliance on this safe harbor.

&ensp; &ensp; (2)  *Network Maturity.*  Network Maturity is the status of a decentralized or functional network that is achieved when the network is either:

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (i)  Not economically or operationally controlled and is not reasonably likely to be economically or operationally controlled or unilaterally changed by any single person, entity, or group of persons or entities under common control, except that networks for which the Initial Development Team owns more than 20% of Tokens or owns more than 20% of the means of determining network consensus cannot satisfy this condition; or

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (ii)  Functional, as demonstrated by the holders’ use of Tokens for the transmission and storage of value on the network, the participation in an application running on the network, or otherwise in a manner consistent with the utility of the network.

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; The definition is not meant to preclude network alterations achieved through a predetermined procedure in the source code that uses a consensus mechanism and approval of network participants.

&ensp; &ensp; (3)  *Related Person.*  Related person means the Initial Development Team, directors or advisors to the Initial Development Team, and any immediately family member of such persons.  

&ensp; &ensp; (4)  *Token.*  A Token is a digital representation of value or rights

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (i)  that has a transaction history that:

**Proposed Securities Act (Ontario) Section 21.12.  Exemption from the definition of “exchange” under Section 21 of the Act. **

An organization, association, or group of persons shall be exempt from the definition of the term “exchange” to the extent such organization, association, or group of persons constitutes, maintains, or provides a marketplace or facilitates bringing together purchasers and sellers of Tokens satisfying the conditions of Sectoin 73.8 of the Securities Act (Ontario), or otherwise performs with respect to such Tokens the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, but does not take custody of the Tokens of the purchasers or sellers and provies instantaneous settlement of exchanges of Tokens, and therefore does not fit within the definition of a Crypto Contract for purposes of establishing the jurisdiction of securities regulators in Ontario.

**Proposed Securities Act (Ontario) Setion 35(1)4.  Exemption from the registration requirements for a dealer engaged in a Token transaction.**

A person or company is exempt from the requirement to be registered under the Securities Act (Ontario) to act as a dealer when trading in Tokens or acting as an underwriter in respect of Token distributions, to the extent it engages in the business of effecting transactions in Tokens satisfying the conditions of Rule 73.8 of the Securities Act (Ontario) for the account of others.
